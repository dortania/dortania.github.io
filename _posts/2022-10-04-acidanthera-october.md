# Acidanthera Updates: A message from PMheart

Having experienced a chilling September, October comes after a nice weekend. Following iOS 16, macOS Ventura is coming soon.

As usual, there are no critical updates to OpenCore 0.8.5, as recent beta versions of macOS 13 tend to be stable. To begin with, @Andrey1970AppleLife updated builtin firmware versions which might be useful for the official macOS update. Then, several more updates regarding Hyper-V, including the correction for CPU objects that are exclusively available in Windows Server 2022, and extra hot-adding/removing device path expansion support, have been carried out by @Goldfish64. As well, we improved verbose logging for kernel patching, which can be useful for developers to filter patcher status. That's it.

@Goldfish64 pushed a bunch of updates to MacHyperVSupport 0.9.2: The issue with control key pressing has been fixed, together with DMA allocation problems and another one with buffer overrun in network packet sending; VMBus implemenations get improved; intermittent hangs storage and network drivers are addressed. Finally, he added support for storage disk hot-adding/removing and that for guest restart via Restart-VM; time synchronization support for the guest machine has landed as well.

Thanks to the hard work of @dhinakg and @khronokernel, those CPU models without AVX2.0 support can boot normally by installing the Apple Silicon Cryptex (OS.dmg) with the help of the new Lilu plugin - CryptexFixup. Still, this breaks delta updates ([ref](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/2080)), and we are looking forward to patches and contributions to this.

For VoodooPS2, we would like to give credits to @diepeterpan who fixed disabled keyboard after reboot. Users with the common problems can now enjoy VoodooPS2 2.3.1. Also, @lalithkota improved compatibility with BCM43142A0 on macOS Big Sur in BrcmPatchRAM 2.6.4.

Enjoy,

â€” PMheart
