# A message from vit9696

This month completes the vacation season, and this time we have something special to present. For a long time Linux support was a grey area in OpenCore. It worked and we fixed the reported issues when it did not. However, one needed to perform a fair amount of work to make Linux natively display in the OpenCore boot pickers, whether built-in or the shiny OpenCanopy. This fall, this is finally changing.

With OpenCore 0.7.3, we present a preview version of the OpenLinuxBoot.efi driver, which delivers first-class Linux support for OpenCore without any chainloading required like GRUB or rEFInd. @MikeBeaton did a really great job on this. His driver supports all sorts of distributions, including [blspec](https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION) compatibility, automatic detection of other installation types / schemes, and even manual configuration for particularily peculiar setups. There is a comprehensive section on how to use it in the reference manual, as well as in the discussion for the [PR](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/pull/282). While we have had positive experiences so far, we must still warn you that the driver has just landed and is still in a beta stage.

Among other bootloader changes there are several stability fixes, new quirks for older hardware courtesy of @mhaeuser, and security revampments by @MikhailKrichanov. As for the drivers, WhateverGreen got a long awaited backlight smoothing support for the Intel GPUs thanks to @0xFireWolf. After months of hard work from @Goldfish64 AppleALC and VirtualSMC are now available on 32-bit macOS versions up to 10.4 for the first time. To add more, VoodooPS2 also received support for the touchpad muxers thanks to @1Revenger1.
