# A message from vit9696

Welcome to 2022! We are glad to meet you with this year's first update of our products. After getting the well deserved rest, which lasts a bit longer in Russia than the winter holidays in several other countries, we tried to push all the fixes for the most annoying issues.

Lilu now works correctly with some third-party plugins on macOS Catalina and older after introducing a regression by the December update. Thanks to @Goshin for their time and patience tracking this down. RestrictEvents now also blocks the unreadable disk popup and enables the memory configuration view on all models thanks to @Goldfish64. @khronokernel additionally included new abilities for Hypervisor spoofing used in OCLP on legacy Macs.

AppleALC got controller patch improvements following the Z690 series as well as the new audio resources. gfxutil was fixed to support Apple Silicon as well as parse legacy Mac device paths, thanks to @joevt. FeatureUnlock also includes fixes for the AirPlay to Mac support introduced in the previous release.

As for OpenCore, it got two major changes. First is the audio driver reengineering, which allowed for support of many more audio controllers including Apple hardware, thanks to @mikebeaton, and second is the quirk we created to activate the efficiency cores on Intel Alder Lake. More details on Intel Alder Lake are provided in a [separate post](https://dortania.github.io/hackintosh/updates/2022/01/09/alder-lake.html).

Have a nice winter,

â€” Vit
