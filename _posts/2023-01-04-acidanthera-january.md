# Acidanthera Updates: A message from PMheart

Happy belated new year!

OpenCore 0.8.8 includes several practical fixes: Synchronising with upstream, @savvamitrofanov updated the EDK II package to `edk2-stable202211`. As well, @Andrey1970AppleLife provided us with the latest firmware and keyboard layout information. On Apple Silicon, the prebuilt mtoc binary is now universal, together with fixed OpenDuet build and new secure PE/COFF loader. The ocvalidate tool now allows duplicate tool if FullNvramAccess is different, authored by @mikebeaton. As for the kernel patching engine, @Goldfish64 fixed blocking entries not being processed if one was skipped due to `Arch`. In addition, he also fixed intermittent prelinking failures caused by XML corruption when kext blocking is enabled. @vit9696 also changed the logic of picker hiding: now the magic Acidanthera sequence from OpenCore files is removed, and `.contentVisibility` file is added to hide and disable boot entries. For better Duet debugging, QemuBuild.command supports Linux thanks to @MikhailKrichanov's effort. Last but not least, @Goldfish64 added SD card device path support for boot device selection.

Having hibernated for nearly two years, VoodooInput 1.1.3 is revived with trackpoint logic improvements by @1Revenger1, seperated X and Y axis, higher solution. The addition of divisor for scroll and mouse movement also makes the Voodoo projects better ones. One more thing, @kprinssu worked around crashes with USB devices on macOS 13.

In FeatureUnlock 1.1.2, @khronokernel added AirPlay to Mac unlocking inside Control Center.app.

With continuous contributions to our AppleALC database, new layout configurations for ALC255, ALC1220, ALCS1220A, and 700 series PCH HD Audio have been added thanks to @juniorcaesar, @CaseySJ, and @dreamwhite; these are added to AppleALC 1.7.8.

Included in WhateverGreen 1.6.3, @nikey22 added various GPU identifiers from different Macs, together with the new property `disable-telemetry-load` which disables iGPU telemetry loading by @Goldfish64.

VoodooPS2 2.3.3 fixed scrolling and button issues, as well as DynamicEWMode problem on Lenovo ThinkPad Laptops, thanks to @1Revenger1.

@al3xtjames added Raptor Lake CPU model as of Lilu 1.6.3.

Enjoy,

â€” PMheart
