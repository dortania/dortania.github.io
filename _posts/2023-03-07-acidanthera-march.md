# Acidanthera Updates: A message from PMheart

Hello. Sorry guys! I have been sick and busy moving, hence I skipped the February 2023 message.

While there is not much listed in the changelog, OpenCore 0.9.0 has improvements on graphics thanks to @mikebeaton, including verbose boot log appearance, versioning information for the `EnableGop UI` tool, and AMD support and GOP offset auto-detection, with which macOS 10.11+ gets support for the EnableGop vBIOS insertion script. As well, the quirk `ProvideCurrentCpuInfo` now supports macOS 13.3 DP. Lastly, we included precompiled EDK-II EfiRom and GenFfs in Utilities/BaseTools with OpenCore releases.

For many years, AppleALC 1.8.0 enlarges its codec and layout database again with new and improved support for ALC274 (layout-id 28), ALC256 (layout-id 95), and ALC236 (layout-id 55) thanks to contributions from @Tweakkinn, @Floron, and @8DireZ3.

As a minor improvement, MaciASL 1.6.4 deletes broken URLs patches.

In the wake of stability, VirtualSMC 1.3.1 includes a tiny fix for `smcread -l` output.

VoodooPS2 2.3.4 introduces two fixes: device count detection when ps2rst=0 is set, and handleClose not being called by VoodooInput, thanks to @1Revenger1.

Last but not least, Lilu 1.6.4 adds AMD IGPU detection.

Enjoy,

â€” PMheart
