# Acidanthera Updates: A message from PMheart

Embracing a warm spring, we published our 2023.04 releases.

OpenCore 0.9.1 brings better support for legacy graphic cards together with bug fixes. To begin with, @corpnewt fixed a minor printing bug in ocvalidate which led to the failure of message printing. @mikebeaton made VS Code debugging easier by providing sample config for gdb. As well, he implemented `GopBurstMode` quirk for faster GOP operation on older firmware; now `SysReport` will also include GOP memory caching reports. Thanks to @vit9696's discovery, we also integrated the new patch for `ThirdPartyDrives` quirk on macOS 13.3 and above. Last but not least, @Andrey1970AppleLife has always continuously updated builtin firmware versions.

macOS Ventura introduced a new check for Continuity Camera which is only available on Kaby Lake and above. FeatureUnlock 1.1.4 patches this restriction to make it possible everywhere thanks to @khronokernel.

Users' consistent maintenance to AppleALC database has been integrated into AppleALC 1.8.1 as well. We would like to thank @lgh07711, @DalianSky, @Pinokyo-H, @wern-apfel, and @imoize, for their contibutions to the configurations of ALC293, Alder Lake PCH-P High Definition Audio Controller (0x51C8), ALC269, ALC623, ALC295, and ALC255 respectively.

To investigate NSS issues, @lvs1974 updated AirportBrcmFixup to 2.1.7 to dump debugging logs from the methods `AirPort_BrcmNIC::setTX_NSS`, `AirPort_BrcmNIC::getTX_NSS`, and `AirPort_BrcmNIC::getNSS`.

As of RestrictEvents 1.1.0, it is possible to disable `hw.optional.f16c` on macOS 13.3 and above. This is particularly useful on Ivy Bridge CPUs where AVX 2.0 instructions are not present, resulting in CoreGraphics.framework crash.

We appreciate @AsdMonio who fixed `board-id` length calculation for legacy Mac models where it is shorter. This is now integrated into BrcmPatchRAM 2.6.5.

In BrightnessKeys 1.0.3, @ChefKissInc added support for certain laptops including AMD ones where `kIOACPILegacyPanel` is used.

Thanks to @1Revenger1, one of the primary authors of our VoodooPS2 project, version 2.3.5 removed `actAsTrackpad` and related logic; and on Elan Touchpads, Trackpoint logic is now powered by VoodooInput.

Enjoy,
