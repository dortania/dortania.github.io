# Acidanthera Updates: A message from PMheart

Hello folks! We are late, but 2023.05 releases are worth waiting.

First, OpenCore 0.9.2 brings significant improvements on `GopBurstMode` thanks to @mikebeaton: guard checks which ensure that it is not arbitrarily turned on; compatibility with non-standard GOP implementations; fix for potential hang on DEBUG builds; and even support for natively supported cards. The other fixes and improvements cannot be neglected either: @CaseySJ introduces a new kext quirk `DisableIoMapperMapping` which resolves conflicts in AppleVTD. As well, @vit9696 ensures that single user mode is disabled when Apple Secure Boot is enabled. Following the fix of `ThirdPartyDrives` on macOS 13.3 and above, `ExternalDiskIcons` also functions correctly now, thanks to @fusion71au. The `Builtin` text renderer receives various updates, together with the new `InitialMode`. Also, `LogModules` now supports a new `?` filter for matching non-standard log lines. Last but not least, `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` is enabled back on macOS 13, to patch the injected `AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement` kext. There are also other minor improvements. Please review the full changelog below.

Lilu 1.6.5 can now detect Recovery and Installer mode on macOS 13, too. Thus, it is essential to upgrade together with plugin kexts.

As always, we continue to appreciate contributions to AppleALC database, including ALC1220 layout-id 18 for Gigabyte Z490 Aorus Master by hgsshaanxi, and layout-id 21 for ALC298 on X270 by MKjanek32. There are bundled in AppleALC 1.8.2.

RestrictEvents 1.1.1 fixes `f16c` patch misreporting other `hw.optional` features.

Last but not least, BrcmPatchRAM 2.6.6 integrates firmware for legacy BCM20702A1, thanks to @chapuza.

Enjoy,

â€” PMheart
