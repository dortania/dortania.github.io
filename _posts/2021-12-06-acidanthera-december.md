# A message from vit9696

Good evening,

As some of you already noticed, winter is coming. However, unlike the streets freezing and getting covered with snow, the development here starts to accelerate. This time we worked hard to get better support for Intel Alder Lake, about which we are going to give a separate post. Other than that, we addressed a few unpleasant bugs that affected certain legacy systems in a pretty bad manner.

First, Intel Alder Lake. This required a substantial amount of changes in OpenCore and kexts, and we believe it is possible that more changes might happen in the future. OpenCore currently recognises the 12th CPU generation by Intel and includes several ACPI samples that make the bring-up process smoother. We also adjusted some quirks like `ProvideConsoleGop` to workaround ASUS firmware specialties. Thanks to @R-a-s-c-a-l, AppleALC was updated to support Z690's audio controller, although we have not been able to test this ourselves yet. We also crafted a pilot version of the CpuTopologySync driver, allowing the use of efficiency cores in macOS. I thank @vandroiy2013 for spending days and nights debugging this piece of hardware, giving smart ideas, and all in all helping me understand the caveats.

Thanks to @Goldfish64, OpenCore now supports higher resolution mode-set on old NVIDIA GPUs through the BiosVideo driver. OpenCore will also let one automatically select the display scaling depending on the connected screen, which eases the ability to swap monitors. To switch to this new option one will need to perform an NVRAM reset, and @PMheart also updated ocvalidate to ensure that new settings have appropriate values. Label scrolling glitches were also fixed in OpenCanopy thanks to @mikebeaton and @mhaeuser. We hope that the overall rendering experience will be a little better with this update.

`ProtectUefiServices` will no longer crash certain Dell computers thanks to @al3xtjames and `FadtEnableReset` will make sure Dell computers reboot thanks to @Goldfish64 again. `ScanPolicy` can now handle old Samsung NVMe drives, which are exposed as PCI drives, not NVMe. Thanks to @mikebeaton, legacy Macs can get virtual machine support not just in macOS through `EnableVmx` quirk. After @mikhailkrichanov's updates GCC builds are functional again.

Lilu got crash fixes on 10.15 and older. With the recent efforts of @khronokernel and @dhinakg, FeatureUnlock received updated patches for macOS 12.1 and minor performance improvements. @lvs1974 additionally pushed some compatibility fixes into SMCDellSensors.

That makes it for this evening.
