# Acidanthera Updates: A message from PMheart

Embracing the final release of macOS Ventura and following Halloween, we entered November 2022.

Overall speaking, OpenCore 0.8.6 brings several groundbreaking changes. To begin with, @mikebeaton updated the LogoutHook script for the compatibility with earlier versions of macOS and brought the capability of automatic installation as launch daemon/logout hook on Yosemite and above. As well, @mikebeaton fixed a recursive loop crash and early logging failure, and resolved wake-from-sleep failure on EFI 1.1 systems. After months of hard work, @mhaeuser has brought the most impressive feature in this release, dwell-clicking, to our bootloader. As always, @Andrey1970AppleLife ensures that firmware/SMBIOS info is up-to-date.

After nearly one year of hibernation, MaciASL got a minor improvement where line number breaking during scroll has been fixed, thanks to @SkyrilHD.

For AppleALC 1.7.6, we would like to thank @anderson-suga, @andreszerocross, @mishurov, and @RockJesus for their contributions to our audio configuration database.

In CryptexFixup 1.0.1, @khronokernel added support for in-OS macOS installation via Install macOS.app on Big Sur and newer. As well, he refactored model patch set detection, and replaced the previously unused boot argument `-disable_uni_control` with `-disable_sidecar_mac` in FeatureUnlock 1.1.0. Last but not least, in RestrictEvents 1.0.9, the new `revblock` userspace processes blocking is added, together with `displaypolicyd` blocking for genuine `MacBookPro9,1/10,1`, `mediaanalysisd` for Metal 1 GPUs on Ventura, and conditional blocking for PCIe/memory notifications on `MacPro7,1` SMBIOS.

Enjoy,

â€” PMheart
