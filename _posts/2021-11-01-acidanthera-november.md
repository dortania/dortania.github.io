# A message from vit9696

Good evening,

Considering all the effort spent on making our projects feature-rich and stable, we have long awaited the monthly changelist to decrease in size and contain less ground-breaking adjustments. While we have not reached this state yet, this release is a great example of our shift to a new strategy. The main changes are dictated by three factors: macOS changes, hardware releases, and security enhancements we continue to pursue.

The updates to OpenCore include a long-awaited feature: Resizable BAR configuration for GPUs. Resizable BAR is a PCI specification feature which allows control of the amount of video memory visible from the CPU. While macOS does support this feature, it limits the supported BAR sizes by 1 GB and seems to be unstable with BARs above 256 MB. If both your GPU and your firmware support Resizable BAR, setting `ResizeAppleGpuBars` to `0` will update GPU registers to their defaults when booting macOS and fix the hangs on newer boards. The [updated reference manual](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/0.7.5/Docs/Configuration.pdf) includes all the relevant details for the technically inclined. Among the other improvements are recovery image signature checking in `macrecovery` by @jspraul and @zhangyoufu, ensuring that the image is not corrupted and comes directly from Apple, and minor OpenLinuxBoot improvements by @MikeBeaton, resolving an annoying hang with some distributions.

As for kernel driver changes, after the Bluetooth stack overhaul in macOS 12, we are still trying to get things in line. Thanks to contributions from @dhinakg, @usr-sse2, @williambj1, and @zxystd, BlueToolFixup makes most devices work on any Mac model with on-off support. Please note that Continuity and AirDrop features may not function correctly [for the time being](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1821) on macOS 12. Other than that, with @lvs1974 we extended Lilu APIs to support trampoline routing on macOS 10.15 and earlier, which fixed an unpleasant regression in HibernationFixup and CpuTscSync causing boot or sleep wake failures. @kingo132 added PWM backlight control for AMD 5000-series to WhateverGreen and @0xFireWolf resolved some flickering issues on Ice Lake GPUs. Thanks to @1Revenger1, VoodooPS2 got a bugfix for the recently added muxing code, which caused some devices to crash on sleep wake.

This is all for the highlights, we hope you enjoy macOS 12 on your non-production systems. Besides that, while we are moderately excited about the imminent release of Intel Alder Lake, we use this message as a reminder that this platform is not supported and may actually have architectural incompatibilities with macOS.
