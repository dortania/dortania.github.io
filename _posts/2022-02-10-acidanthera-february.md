# A message from vit9696

Good evening,

We have just released one more stability upgrade:

* Thanks to @mikebeaton, OpenCore will finally work correctly with SIP values, OpenLinuxBoot will no longer crash on partially valid setups, and AudioDxe will work as normal with older macOS versions.
* @Goldfish64 updated RestrictEvents to work with older macOS versions and also fixed its configuration abilities, making them more logical.
* With the help of @Sergey-Galan and others, more codec controller patches were updated to the new format, resolving some HDMI issues in AppleALC.
* @mikebeaton also updated alc-verb to more closely resemble hda-verb behaviour in Linux to increase the interoperability.
* AirportBrcmFixup was updated by @lvs1974 to be more stable on macOS 12.1+.
* @Ph-FrX fixed several backlight issues in WhateverGreen on Ice Lake platforms.

While that makes it for today, we are currently working on improving bootloader security and reliability.

Stay safe,

â€” Vit
