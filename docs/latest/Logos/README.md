OpenCore Logo
=============

This directory contains OpenCore project official logo. The following
formats are supported:

- Sketch source file
- Portable Document Format (PDF)
- Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

SVG format is currently not recommended, as it contains an approximated
version of the logo, which has slightly wrong colourspace due to missing
conic gradient support in SVG.

You may use this logo free of charge to refer to OpenCore project for
informational purposes. You have no right to modify logo. 
The use of this logo in your own projects which
are related to OpenCore is also permitted free of charge, yet requires
OpenCore maintainer approval. Please
[contact us](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/new)
for more details.

We would like to express our deep gratitude to
[Anadea Inc.](http://anadea.info) designing team for their brilliant work
and extreme patience!
