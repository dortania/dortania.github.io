<!--l. 644--><p class="noindent" >To install OpenCore, replicate the ?? described in the previous section in the EFI volume of a GPT partition. While
corresponding sections of this document provide some information regarding external resources such as ACPI tables, UEFI
drivers, or kernel extensions (kexts), completeness of the matter is out of the scope of this document. Information about kernel
extensions may be found in a separate <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Kexts.md" >Kext List</a> document available in the OpenCore repository. Vaulting information is
provided in the ?? section of this document.
</p><!--l. 656--><p class="noindent" >The OC config file, as with any property list file, can be edited with any text editor, such as nano or vim. However, specialised
software may provide a better experience. On macOS, the preferred GUI application is <a

utilised</span>.
</p><!--l. 666--><p class="noindent" >It is strongly <span class="sout">advised not to use any software that is </span><span class="uwave">recommended to avoid configuration creation tools that are </span>aware of the
internal <span class="sout">configration structure as it constantly gets out of date and will cause incorrect configuration to be generated. If it is a

configurations (since the structure gets constantly updated). If such tools are to be used despite this warning,
ensure that only </span>stable versions of OpenCore <span class="sout">with explicit support for the particular version in the app. The
choice </span><span class="uwave">explicitly supported by such tools are used. In such cases, the use </span>of open-source implementations with

</p><!--l. 681--><p class="noindent" >For BIOS booting, a third-party UEFI environment provider is required and OpenDuetPkg is one such UEFI environment
provider for legacy systems. To run OpenCore on such a legacy system, OpenDuetPkg can be installed with a dedicated tool —
BootInstall (bundled with OpenCore). <a 
href="https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS" >Third-party utilities</a> can be used to perform this on systems other than
macOS.
</p><!--l. 688--><p class="noindent" >For upgrade purposes, refer to the Differences.pdf document which provides information about changes to the configuration
(as compared to the previous release) as well as to the Changelog.md document (which contains a list of modifications across
all published updates).

<!--l. 695--><p class="noindent" >OpenCore can be compiled as a standard <a 
href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II" >EDK II</a> package and requires the <a 
href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II#stable-tags" >EDK II Stable</a> package. The currently supported
EDK II release is hosted in <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/audk" >acidanthera/audk</a>. Required patches for this package can be found in the Patches
directory.
</p><!--l. 703--><p class="noindent" >The only officially supported toolchain is XCODE5. Other toolchains might work but are neither supported nor recommended.
Contributions of clean patches are welcome. Please do follow <a 
href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Code-Style-C" >EDK II C Codestyle</a>.
</p><!--l. 708--><p class="noindent" >To compile with XCODE5, besides <a 
href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode" >Xcode</a>, users should also install <a 
href="https://www.nasm.us" >NASM</a> and <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/ocbuild/tree/master/external" >MTOC</a>. The latest Xcode version is recommended
for use despite the toolchain name. An example command sequence is as follows:
