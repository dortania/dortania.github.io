<!--l. 644--><p class="noindent" >To install OpenCore, replicate the ?? described in the previous section in the EFI volume of a GPT partition. While
corresponding sections of this document provide some information regarding external resources such as ACPI tables, UEFI
drivers, or kernel extensions (kexts), completeness of the matter is out of the scope of this document. Information about kernel
extensions may be found in a separate <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Kexts.md" >Kext List</a> document available in the OpenCore repository. Vaulting information is
provided in the ?? section of this document.
</p><!--l. 656--><p class="noindent" >The OC config file, as with any property list file, can be edited with any text editor, such as nano or vim. However, specialised
software may provide a better experience. On macOS, the preferred GUI application is <a

utilised</span>.
</p><!--l. 666--><p class="noindent" >It is strongly <span class="sout">advised not to use any software that is </span><span class="uwave">recommended to avoid configuration creation tools that are </span>aware of the
internal <span class="sout">configration structure as it constantly gets out of date and will cause incorrect configuration to be generated. If it is a

configurations (since the structure gets constantly updated). If such tools are to be used despite this warning,
ensure that only </span>stable versions of OpenCore <span class="sout">with explicit support for the particular version in the app. The
choice </span><span class="uwave">explicitly supported by such tools are used. In such cases, the use </span>of open-source implementations with

</p><!--l. 681--><p class="noindent" >For BIOS booting, a third-party UEFI environment provider is required and OpenDuetPkg is one such UEFI environment
provider for legacy systems. To run OpenCore on such a legacy system, OpenDuetPkg can be installed with a dedicated tool —
BootInstall (bundled with OpenCore). <a 
href="https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS" >Third-party utilities</a> can be used to perform this on systems other than
macOS.
</p><!--l. 688--><p class="noindent" >For upgrade purposes, refer to the Differences.pdf document which provides information about changes to the configuration
(as compared to the previous release) as well as to the Changelog.md document (which contains a list of modifications across
all published updates).

<!--l. 695--><p class="noindent" >OpenCore can be compiled as a standard <a 
href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II" >EDK II</a> package and requires the <a 
href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II#stable-tags" >EDK II Stable</a> package. The currently supported
EDK II release is hosted in <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/audk" >acidanthera/audk</a>. Required patches for this package can be found in the Patches
directory.
</p><!--l. 703--><p class="noindent" >The only officially supported toolchain is XCODE5. Other toolchains might work but are neither supported nor recommended.
Contributions of clean patches are welcome. Please do follow <a 
href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Code-Style-C" >EDK II C Codestyle</a>.
</p><!--l. 708--><p class="noindent" >To compile with XCODE5, besides <a 
href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode" >Xcode</a>, users should also install <a 
href="https://www.nasm.us" >NASM</a> and <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/ocbuild/tree/master/external" >MTOC</a>. The latest Xcode version is recommended
for use despite the toolchain name. An example command sequence is as follows:
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                  
         </p><!--l. 6325--><p class="noindent" >The following notes apply to all of the above options:
         </p><!--l. 6327--><p class="noindent" >Note 1: Apple filesystems APFS and HFS are never scanned.
         </p><!--l. 6330--><p class="noindent" >Note 2: Regardless of the above flags, a file system must first be allowed by Misc/Security/ScanPolicy
         before it can be seen by OpenLinuxBoot or any other OC_BOOT_ENTRY_PROTOCOL driver.
         </p><!--l. 6335--><p class="noindent" >Note 3: It is recommended to enable scanning LINUX_ROOT and LINUX_DATA in both OpenLinuxBoot flags
         and Misc/Security/ScanPolicy in order to be sure to detect all valid Linux installs.

         <!--l. 6340--><p class="noindent" >0x00000100 (bit 8) — LINUX_BOOT_ALLOW_AUTODETECT, If set allows autodetecting and linking vmlinuz*

         <li class="itemize">

         selected as the default boot entry in OpenCore, automatically switch to the latest kernel when a new version
         is installed.
         </p><!--l. 6347--><p class="noindent" >When this option is set, an internal menu entry id is shared between kernel versions from the same install
         of Linux. Linux boot options are always sorted highest kernel version first, so this means that the latest
         kernel version of the same install always shows as the default, with this option set.
         </p><!--l. 6351--><p class="noindent" >Note: This option is recommended on all systems.

         Debian-style distrubutions, not to BLSpec and Fedora-style distributions with /loader/entries/*.conf
         files). Some distrubtions run a filesystem check on loading which requires the root filesystem to initially
         be mounted read-only via the ro kernel option. Set this bit to add this option on autodetected distros;
         should be harmless but very slightly slow down boot time (due to requried remount as read-write) on distros
         which do not require it. To specify this option for specific distros only, use partuuidopts:{partuuid}+=ro
         instead of this flag<span class="uwave">. </span>

     are never used for entries created from /loader/entries/*.conf files.
     </p><!--l. 6382--><p class="noindent" >Note: The partuuid value to be specified here is typically the same as the PARTUUID seen in root=PARTUUID=... in the
     Linux kernel boot options (view using cat /proc/cmdline) for autodetected Debian-style distros, but is NOT the same
     for Fedora-style distros booted from /loader/entries/*.conf files.

     use, look for LNX: entries in the OpenCore debug log file. Alternatively, and for more advanced scenarios, you
     may wish to examine how your drives are mounted using the Linux mount command, and then find out
