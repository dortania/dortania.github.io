</p><!--l. 6341--><p class="noindent" >Most Linux <span class="sout">distributions keep their boot files on an EXT4 partition even when the distribution’s root filesystem is something

when booting via OpenLinuxBoot and via the distro’s original bootloader. If the default bootloader is GRUB, expect the
options generated by OpenLinuxBoot not to contain a </span><span class="uwave">BOOT_IMAGE=...</span> <span class="uwave">value where the GRUB options do, and to contain an
</span><span class="uwave">initrd=...</span> <span class="uwave">value while the GRUB options do not. All remaining options should match (option order does not matter) –
perhaps excluding less important graphics handover options (such as in the Ubuntu example given in </span><span class="uwave">autoopts</span> <span class="uwave">below). If they
do not, it is recommended to manually add the missing options, e.g. with </span><span class="uwave">partuuidopts:{partuuid}+={opts}</span> <span class="uwave">to target a
